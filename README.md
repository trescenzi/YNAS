# YNAS; You need a sankey

YNAS generates an explorable sankey diagram for your ynab budgets.

## Usage

Currently YNAS requires a manual approach of setting your api key, and budget
name in a local `.env` file.

EX:
```
YNAB_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
BUDGET_NAME=Comprehensive
```

Once you've set your API Key just run `yarn dev`.
